-- Level 100 now costs 10,000 XP instead of 2,000.
--
-- The shape of the climb is untouched: every threshold is exactly five times
-- what it was, so the same proportion of the journey sits between any two
-- levels as before. Only the scale moved.
--
-- Nothing compensates the XP already earned, which is the point -- the levels
-- people hold are meant to come down. XP itself is derived (uploads*10 +
-- likes*2 + bookmarks*2 + comments), so there is nothing stored to migrate:
-- every level is recomputed from this array the next time it is read.
--
-- js/misc-core.js carries the same array for the progress bar and has to be
-- changed with this file, or the bar and the level will disagree.
