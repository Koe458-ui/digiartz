-- An album's cover is one image: the first one put in it.
--
-- get_user_albums returned up to four image_urls, newest first, because the
-- card drew them as a 2x2 mosaic. The card is a single cover now, and the
-- picture that represents an album should be the one that started it -- so this
-- returns exactly one, the earliest added.
--
-- The column stays a text[] so the shape of the result does not change; it just
-- carries one element instead of four.
